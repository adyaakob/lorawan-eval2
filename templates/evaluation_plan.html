                <p class="lead">This report outlines the evaluation plan for a LoRaWAN-based real-time worker tracking system proposed by TEQ Armada Sdn Bhd to Sabah Softwoods Berhad (softwood.com.my). It details the project background, user requirements, proposed system architecture, and the rationale for selecting specific devices for the evaluation.</p>

                <section class="mb-5">
                    <h2>Project Background</h2>
                    <p>This project aims to enhance worker safety and optimize operational efficiency in Sabah Softwoods Berhad's oil palm plantations. Traditional tracking methods are inadequate due to the vast, densely vegetated areas and limitations of GPS and cellular signals under the palm canopy. This LoRaWAN-based system seeks to overcome these challenges by providing real-time worker location data and reliable communication, even in areas with limited cellular coverage.</p>

                    <h2>Key Requirements</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Real-time tracking:</strong> Continuous monitoring of 4,500 workers across nine estates (Mawang, Sg Tiagau, Bukit Tuok, Kumani, Kapilit, Sg Indit, Banita, Cenderamata, and Dumpas).</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Utilize LoRaWAN technology for its long-range coverage (up to 10km in rural areas), low power consumption, and ability to penetrate dense foliage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Deploy solar-powered LoRaWAN gateways for sustainable operation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Ensure seamless integration with existing HQ management systems for data analysis and reporting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Overcome cellular limitations:</strong> Address limited cellular coverage in Sabah's remote areas by providing reliable communication through the LoRaWAN network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="mb-5">
                    <h2>System Purpose</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced safety:</strong> Real-time location tracking enables immediate response to emergencies and accidents.</li>

                    <h2>Equipment for Evaluation</h2>
                    <p>Due to the unavailability of the proposed HKT GT-100 trackers for immediate field evaluation, alternative devices will be used to gather preliminary data and assess the feasibility of the system. The following equipment will be used for the evaluation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>End-user devices:</strong> Dragino Tracker D LoRaWAN GPS trackers</li>
                        <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> Dragino Outdoor Gateway DL0S86 (AS923) with 4G EC25</li>

                    <h2>Compromises with Evaluation Equipment</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GPS Accuracy:</strong> The HKT GT-100 may offer better accuracy due to its dual-frequency band reception (L1 and L5) and anti-jamming capabilities. The Dragino Tracker D relies solely on GPS and BLE positioning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Set:</strong> The Dragino Tracker D includes additional features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, motion detection, and temperature/humidity sensors, which are not present in the HKT GT-100. These differences could affect battery life and performance comparisons.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ruggedness:</strong> The HKT GT-100 has an IP67 waterproof rating, while the Dragino Tracker D's ruggedness specifications are not explicitly stated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> The Milesight SG50 is designed for solar power with battery backup, while the Dragino DL0S86 relies on a 5V, 2A DC power supply.</li>
