**Cost Optimization Notes:**

The total project cost can be optimized by considering the following:

1. **Reduced Tracker Quantity:** Using only three Dragino Tracker D devices instead of five can reduce the equipment cost by RM630.  
2. **Existing Equipment:** If a suitable laptop and high-accuracy GPS device are already available, the equipment cost can be further reduced by RM8,000. Additionally, if the mapping software can be loaned from the supplier, this eliminates the need to purchase a license.  
3. **Negotiating with SSB:** Explore the possibility of reducing SSB team support costs by providing packed lunches or negotiating a lower daily rate for meals.

| Cost Item | Original Cost (RM) | Optimized Cost (RM) | Difference (RM) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Dragino Tracker D | 1,575 | 945 | 630 |
| Laptop & GPS | 8,000 | 0 | 8,000 |
| **Total** | **9,575** | **945** | **8,630** |

By implementing these cost optimization strategies, the total project cost can be potentially reduced by RM8,630, resulting in a final cost of RM33,695.

This cost estimation provides a comprehensive overview of the anticipated expenses for the LoRaWAN evaluation project. It includes a detailed breakdown of equipment, travel, personnel, and risk-related costs. This information will be valuable for budgeting and resource allocation to ensure the successful completion of the evaluation.
