## **Total Project Duration: 7 weeks**

This timeline provides a high-level overview of the project implementation. The actual durations of individual activities may vary depending on unforeseen circumstances and on-site conditions. Regular communication and collaboration with stakeholders will be crucial throughout the project to ensure its successful completion.

**Critical Milestones:**

* Finalization of the evaluation plan.  
* Completion of equipment procurement and configuration.  
* Successful initial testing in Kuala Lumpur.  
* Completion of on-site evaluation in Sabah.  
* Submission of the final evaluation report.

**Multiple Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1: Optimal Conditions:** All equipment functions as expected, and testing proceeds smoothly. This scenario follows the timeline as outlined above.  
* **Scenario 2: Equipment Delays:** Delays in equipment procurement or shipping may extend the overall project duration. Contingency plans should include alternative suppliers or expedited shipping options.  
* **Scenario 3: On-Site Challenges:** Unforeseen challenges on-site, such as adverse weather conditions or technical difficulties, may require adjustments to the testing schedule. Flexibility and adaptability will be crucial to overcome these challenges.  
* **Scenario 4: Data Analysis Complexity:** If the data analysis requires more time than anticipated, the reporting phase may be extended accordingly.
